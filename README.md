# Malaria-Cell-Images
This project aims to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to detect infected and uninfected cells using the **Malaria** dataset, which contains approximately 27,000 images. The model, built with the Keras library, achieves a prediction accuracy of 97% in identifying whether images show infected or uninfected cells.
